# README: Celestial Companions
# Project Title: Celestial Companions

## Abstract

"Celestial Companions" is more than a visual experience—it’s a story of two individuals, each with unique journeys, coming together to create something extraordinary. Inspired by our own friendship as collaborators, this project depicts two stars traveling distinct paths through a vast universe, symbolizing our diverse backgrounds and perspectives. As the stars journey, their light changes color, representing the evolving phases of life and the differences in individual lifespans. Eventually, the stars meet, merge, and transform into a single radiant entity. The merged star’s growth is not linear—it expands and shrinks at times, symbolizing the struggles and challenges we may face, even when working together. However, the star continues to grow brighter and larger, filling the universe with its light and reflecting the boundless potential of friendship, teamwork and shared vision.


## Inspiration

This project mirrors our journey as creators. Coming from different walks of life, we met and found a shared passion for exploring ideas and turning them into something meaningful. Like the two stars in the project, we began with our individual strengths and perspectives. Through collaboration, we discovered that our differences complemented each other, allowing us to create something we could never have achieved alone. The addition of color-changing lights emphasizes how life evolves uniquely for each individual, while the non-linear growth of the final star reflects how challenges and setbacks are a natural part of success. "Celestial Companions" is a tribute to the power of partnership and the beauty of finding someone whose path aligns with yours, even in the vastness of life’s journey.


## Project Description

The Beginning:
The project begins with a serene starry universe, where two stars navigate distinct paths. The stars represent us—two individuals with unique stories, backgrounds, and skills.

The Journey:
Each star follows its own trajectory, showcasing the individuality and diversity of thought that we brought to this project. As they move, their lights change colors, representing the phases of life and the unique timelines we all experience.

The Meeting:
At a pivotal moment, the stars' paths cross. This is the moment we found each other—not just as friends, but as collaborators. The stars begin to orbit one another, symbolizing how we harmonized our talents and ideas.

The Transformation:
The stars merge, forming a single, brighter entity. The combined star’s growth is not linear—it expands and shrinks at times, reflecting the struggles and challenges that arise even when we collaborate. Yet, with persistence, it grows larger and brighter.

The Universe Illuminated:
The final star overcomes its struggles, fills the universe with its light, and symbolizes the impact of our partnership. This represents the idea that together, despite challenges, we can achieve infinite possibilities.
